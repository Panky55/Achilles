# Exploit

This directory contains the exploit code for the checkm8 BootROM exploit. It is responsible for the following things:
* Exploiting the BootROM
* Executing inital exploit payload
* Patching WXN (Write-implies-execute-never) to let our shellcode run
* Handing off to the main patching code in `boot/`

The writeup for my implementation of the checkm8 exploit is available at [docs/Write-ups/checkm8Writeup.md](../../docs/Write-ups/checkm8Writeup.md).

The exploit is mostly based off of the gaster implementation of the checkm8 exploit, which is available at [0x7FF/gaster](https://github.com/0x7FF/gaster), and this is based off of ipwndfu, which is available at [axi0mX/ipwndfu](https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu).
