# Exploit

This directory contains the exploit code for the checkm8 BootROM exploit. It is responsible for the following things:
* Exploiting the BootROM
* Executing inital exploit payload
* Patching WXN (Write-implies-execute-never) to let our shellcode run
* Handing off to the main patching code in `boot/`

The writeup for my implementation of the checkm8 exploit is available at [docs/ExploitWriteup.md](../../docs/ExploitWriteup.md).
