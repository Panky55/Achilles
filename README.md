# Achilles-v2

Work-in-progress rewrite of Achilles, with a focus on clean code and portability. A proper release announcement will be made when it's ready.

# Features
* Patch signature checks with gaster payloads
* Boot PongoOS on supported devices
* Jailbreak with supplied kernel patchfinder, ramdisk and overlay

# To-do
* Fix payload generation for T8011

This is currently unfinished and untested, so use at your own risk. If in doubt, use the `main` branch.
